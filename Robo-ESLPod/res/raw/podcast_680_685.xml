      <title>685 - Getting Feedback on Writing</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=10291207</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Don’t worry if your writing in English isn’t perfect.  Learn to understand a teacher’s comments on how to improve it in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:15
<br />Explanations: 3:08
<br />Fast dialogue: 17:33</p>

<p>Xica:  I just got my paper back from Professor Rodriguez and it’s all marked up.</p>

<p>Lucas:  Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This is a draft, right?  His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a final version.  He’s trying to help you get a better grade.</p>

<p>Xica:  Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margins.  He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run-on sentence” next to it.</p>

<p>Lucas:  That’s easy to fix, and it is a run-on sentence, you know.</p>

<p>Xica:  And in the body, he wrote that I had no transitions and that my arguments weren’t well supported.</p>

<p>Lucas:  Well, transitions are easy to put in and you just need to cite a few more sources – that’s all.</p>

<p>Xica:  Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the conclusion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.  See what I mean?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay.</p>

<p>Lucas:  I think you should take the constructive criticism as it’s meant – to help you.</p>

<p>Xica:  It’s easy for you to say.  You’re done with college.  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.</p>

<p>Lucas:  True, but you forget that I have my own battle wounds – lots of them!</p>

<p>Amina:  What’s the lowdown on the new guy?</p>

<p>Amina:  You know, the cute one.  Fill me in.  Is he single?</p>

<p>Earl:  I don’t know.  I have no idea.</p>

<p>Amina:  You’re working with him side-by-side and you haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?</p>

<p>Earl:  We talk about work.  It’s not my job to pry into his personal life.</p>

<p>Amina:  I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.</p>

<p>Earl:  You don’t know anything about him, so how do you know he’s perfect?  Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll find out he’s a selfish, self-centered jerk.</p>

<p>Amina:  Wait, catch me up on what’s going on here.  Have other people asked you about him?</p>

<p>Earl:  Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in this office.  They’ve been bombarding me with questions. </p>

<p>Amina:  Oh, sorry.  I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Earl:  Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary.  You women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.</p>

<p>Amina:  Point taken, but do you know if he’s shown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?</p>

<p>Earl:  Ugh!</p>

<p>Melissa:  You’re looking at the next overnight sensation.  I’m uploading my video right now, and by this time tomorrow, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views.  It’s going to go viral.  </p>

<p>Frank:  You and your amateur videos.  Who is going to watch something with such low production value?</p>

<p>Melissa:  You’d be surprised.  I have my own channel on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>Frank:  Are you sure that’s not because your username is AngelinaJolie?</p>

<p>Melissa:  No, it’s because people enjoy my videos, mark them as their favorites, and share them with their friends.  Word of mouth – that’s why I’m so popular.</p>

<p>Frank:  But what about the comments on your videos?  How many of those are positive and how many are negative?</p>

<p>Melissa:  I don’t read the comments.  I assume they’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.  </p>

<p>Frank:  All right, so is this another video of you dancing with your cat?</p>

<p>Melissa:  No, my cat and I are dancing and singing.  That’s why we’re both going to be the next big thing.  </p>

<p>Frank:  Right, I’ll get in line right now to buy tickets to your upcoming Vegas show.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Rise and shine!  Isn’t it a lovely day?  I love getting back to nature.  There’s nothing like going camping.  How did you sleep?</p>

<p>Evan:  That was the most miserable night of my life!  </p>

<p>Cherise:  Really?  What happened?</p>

<p>Evan:  I woke up in the middle of the night and thought I heard a bear.  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.  I have scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.  See?</p>

<p>Cherise:  Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t any bears this late in the year?  </p>

<p>Evan:  How should I have known that?  This was my first time camping.</p>

<p>Cherise:  All right.  Why are you holding your neck like that?  </p>

<p>Evan:  I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping on the ground.  I woke up with a crick in my neck.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Stop moving around like that or you’ll really hurt yourself.</p>

<p>Evan:  Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts!</p>

<p>Cherise:  I told you not to twist around like that.  Just let it work itself out.</p>

<p>Evan:  All of this had to happen to me after getting a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.  I’ve had it!  I’m going back to civilization.  </p>

<p>Cherise:  How are you getting there?</p>

<p>Evan:  What do you mean?  I’m walking.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Without food or water?  You’d better wait for me or you may end up bear bait after all!</p>

<p>Jim:  You know that religion is a taboo subject, especially with Paul.  Why were you baiting him all through dinner?</p>

<p>Tammy:  I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very different views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.</p>

<p>Jim:  You were making disparaging remarks about his faith and some of the things he holds most sacred.  I think you were trying to be provocative.</p>

<p>Tammy:  I may have said a few things that were provocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.</p>

<p>Jim:  There you go again!  People’s religious beliefs shouldn’t be called superstitions.</p>

<p>Tammy:  I’m just calling it like I see it.  I didn’t know you were such a fundamentalist.</p>

<p>Jim:  I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact, I’m an atheist, or at least an agnostic, but I still try to show respect for other people’s beliefs.</p>

<p>Tammy:  Beliefs are made to be challenged.  If you can’t defend your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.</p>

<p>Jim:  Ladies and gentlemen, behold the voice of tolerance.</p>

      <title>680 - Recognizing an Unsung Hero</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the most important people in a project are the ones you never see or hear about.  Learn about them in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:00
<br />Explanations: 2:25
<br />Fast dialogue: 15:42</p>

<p>Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I know the real reason for the success of this project.</p>

<p>Issac:  What?</p>

<p>Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.</p>

<p>Issac:  That’s nonsense.  </p>

<p>Fumi:  No, it’s not.  I know you don’t like the limelight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.  Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.</p>

<p>Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit. I don’t want to hear another word about it.  </p>

<p>Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most unsung heroes like to keep a low profile. </p>

<p>Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!</p>

<p>Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And soon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!</p>

<p>Issac:  What are you proposing to do?</p>

<p>Fumi:  Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker-tape parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are around here!</p>
