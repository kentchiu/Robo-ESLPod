      <description><![CDATA[<p>Meeting your loved one’s family for the first time?  Make sure you know who is who by listening first to this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:07
<br />Explanations: 3:15
<br />Fast dialogue: 18:18</p>

<p>Larissa:  I’m really nervous about meeting your family.</p>

<p>Vince:  You don’t need to be.  They’ll love you and you’ll fit right in.</p>

<p>Larissa:  Okay, but I want to make sure I know everyone I’ll be meeting.  Your Grandmother Celine is the matriarch of the family and your Uncle Nick is the black sheep of the family, is that right?</p>

<p>Vince:  That’s right, but none of us let on that Uncle Nick is considered the prodigal son.  He was really rebellious when he was young and left home when he was 17.  He came back 15 years later, but nobody really knows what happened during that time.  He’s always been a little eccentric.</p>

<p>Larissa:  I’ll be sure to steer clear of Uncle Nick, in that case.  Let’s see, you told me that he is the oldest and your Aunt Sue is the baby of the family.  Where does your Aunt Lily come in?  </p>

<p>Vince:  She’s the middle child and is always the scapegoat for anything that goes wrong.  At least that’s what my grandfather has told me all these years.</p>

<p>Larissa:  That’s your Grandfather Albert, the patriarch of the family, right?</p>

<p>Vince:  Yes, you’ve got it.  I’m impressed you remembered so much about my family.</p>

<p>Larissa:  If I’m walking into the lion’s den, then I want to be prepared.  </p>

<p>Vince:  Don’t think of it that way.  They’re all going to love you.  </p>

<p>Larissa:  Famous last words!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Don’t worry if your writing in English isn’t perfect.  Learn to understand a teacher’s comments on how to improve it in this episode.</p>

<br />Fast dialogue: 17:33</p>

<p>Xica:  I just got my paper back from Professor Rodriguez and it’s all marked up.</p>

<p>Lucas:  Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This is a draft, right?  His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a final version.  He’s trying to help you get a better grade.</p>

<p>Xica:  Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margins.  He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run-on sentence” next to it.</p>

<p>Lucas:  That’s easy to fix, and it is a run-on sentence, you know.</p>

<p>Xica:  And in the body, he wrote that I had no transitions and that my arguments weren’t well supported.</p>

<p>Lucas:  Well, transitions are easy to put in and you just need to cite a few more sources – that’s all.</p>

<p>Xica:  Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the conclusion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.  See what I mean?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay.</p>

<p>Lucas:  I think you should take the constructive criticism as it’s meant – to help you.</p>

<p>Xica:  It’s easy for you to say.  You’re done with college.  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.</p>

<p>Lucas:  True, but you forget that I have my own battle wounds – lots of them!</p>

<p>Amina:  You know, the cute one.  Fill me in.  Is he single?</p>

<p>Amina:  You’re working with him side-by-side and you haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?</p>

<p>Amina:  I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.</p>

<p>Earl:  You don’t know anything about him, so how do you know he’s perfect?  Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll find out he’s a selfish, self-centered jerk.</p>

<p>Amina:  Wait, catch me up on what’s going on here.  Have other people asked you about him?</p>

<p>Earl:  Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in this office.  They’ve been bombarding me with questions. </p>

<p>Amina:  Oh, sorry.  I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Earl:  Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary.  You women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.</p>

<p>Amina:  Point taken, but do you know if he’s shown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?</p>

<p>Earl:  Ugh!</p>

<p>Melissa:  You’re looking at the next overnight sensation.  I’m uploading my video right now, and by this time tomorrow, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views.  It’s going to go viral.  </p>

<p>Frank:  You and your amateur videos.  Who is going to watch something with such low production value?</p>

<p>Melissa:  You’d be surprised.  I have my own channel on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>Frank:  Are you sure that’s not because your username is AngelinaJolie?</p>

<p>Melissa:  No, it’s because people enjoy my videos, mark them as their favorites, and share them with their friends.  Word of mouth – that’s why I’m so popular.</p>

<p>Frank:  But what about the comments on your videos?  How many of those are positive and how many are negative?</p>

<p>Melissa:  I don’t read the comments.  I assume they’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.  </p>

<p>Frank:  All right, so is this another video of you dancing with your cat?</p>

<p>Melissa:  No, my cat and I are dancing and singing.  That’s why we’re both going to be the next big thing.  </p>

<p>Frank:  Right, I’ll get in line right now to buy tickets to your upcoming Vegas show.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Rise and shine!  Isn’t it a lovely day?  I love getting back to nature.  There’s nothing like going camping.  How did you sleep?</p>

<p>Evan:  That was the most miserable night of my life!  </p>

<p>Cherise:  Really?  What happened?</p>

<p>Evan:  I woke up in the middle of the night and thought I heard a bear.  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.  I have scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.  See?</p>

<p>Cherise:  Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t any bears this late in the year?  </p>

<p>Evan:  How should I have known that?  This was my first time camping.</p>

<p>Cherise:  All right.  Why are you holding your neck like that?  </p>

<p>Evan:  I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping on the ground.  I woke up with a crick in my neck.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Stop moving around like that or you’ll really hurt yourself.</p>

<p>Evan:  Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts!</p>

<p>Cherise:  I told you not to twist around like that.  Just let it work itself out.</p>

<p>Evan:  All of this had to happen to me after getting a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.  I’ve had it!  I’m going back to civilization.  </p>

<p>Cherise:  How are you getting there?</p>

<p>Evan:  What do you mean?  I’m walking.</p>

<p>Cherise:  Without food or water?  You’d better wait for me or you may end up bear bait after all!</p>

<p>Jim:  You know that religion is a taboo subject, especially with Paul.  Why were you baiting him all through dinner?</p>

<p>Tammy:  I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very different views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.</p>

<p>Jim:  You were making disparaging remarks about his faith and some of the things he holds most sacred.  I think you were trying to be provocative.</p>

<p>Tammy:  I may have said a few things that were provocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.</p>

<p>Jim:  There you go again!  People’s religious beliefs shouldn’t be called superstitions.</p>

<p>Tammy:  I’m just calling it like I see it.  I didn’t know you were such a fundamentalist.</p>

<p>Jim:  I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact, I’m an atheist, or at least an agnostic, but I still try to show respect for other people’s beliefs.</p>

<p>Tammy:  Beliefs are made to be challenged.  If you can’t defend your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.</p>

<p>Jim:  Ladies and gentlemen, behold the voice of tolerance.</p>

<p>Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I know the real reason for the success of this project.</p>

<p>Issac:  What?</p>

<p>Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.</p>

<p>Issac:  That’s nonsense.  </p>

<p>Fumi:  No, it’s not.  I know you don’t like the limelight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.  Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.</p>

<p>Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit. I don’t want to hear another word about it.  </p>

<p>Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most unsung heroes like to keep a low profile. </p>

<p>Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!</p>

<p>Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And soon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!</p>

<p>Issac:  What are you proposing to do?</p>

<p>Fumi:  Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker-tape parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are around here!</p>

<p>Kurt:  On that we agree.  Your clothes are frumpy and your hairstyle is 10 years out-of-date.  Come on.  I’m taking you to get a new look.  It’ll be a complete transformation.</p>

<p>Ellie:  Okay, I admit that my appearance needs a little updating, but I’m not giving you free rein on what changes to make.</p>

      <title>678 - Reporting Damaged Luggage </title>

<p>I picked up my luggage off of the baggage carousel and noticed that the handle was broken and some of my clothes were falling out of the open zipper.  The bag looked like it had been mishandled, but could someone have tampered with it, too?  I went to the baggage claim office to report what I found.</p>

<p>Clerk:  Next.  How can I help you?</p>

<p>Jordan:  I retrieved my bag and found that it’s been damaged.</p>

<p>Clerk:  What’s the problem?</p>

<p>Jordan:  The handle is broken and I think someone has gone through my bag.</p>

<p>Clerk:  That was probably security.  They may have searched your luggage.</p>

<p>Jordan:  Yes, but my camera is missing and everything is in disarray.  I’m not sure if other things are missing.</p>

<p>Clerk:  Why don’t you make a more thorough inspection over there and then you can file a claim for anything that’s missing or broken.</p>

<p>Jordan:  Will I be compensated for the damage to my luggage and for my missing camera?</p>

<p>Clerk:  I really can’t say.  </p>

<p>Jordan:  How long will it take for someone to contact me?</p>

<p>Clerk:  I really can’t say.  Next!
<br />...</p>

<p>I knew a blow off when I heard it, but I looked through my bag anyway and filled out the forms.  Who knows?  Miracles do happen, don’t they?  </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you difficult to please when it comes to food?  Don’t come to my house!  Instead, listen to this episode to learn how to talk about yourself as an eater.</p>


<p>Slow dialogue: 1:24

<br />Fast dialogue: 14:34</p>

<p>Jeremy:  It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me tonight.  </p>

<p>Keeley:  I’m glad to do it.  You’re been so helpful to me, it’s only fair that I return the favor.  I hope you’ve brought your appetite.  </p>

<p>Jeremy:  You bet.  </p>

<p>Keeley:  Great!  Here’s the first course, a light soup.  How do you like it?</p>

<p>Jeremy:  It has an interesting flavor.  </p>

<p>Keeley:  You don’t care for it.</p>

<p>Jeremy:  It’s just a little greasy for my taste.</p>

<p>Keeley:  Sorry about that.  Why don’t you try this dish?  It’s an old family recipe.  What’s wrong?</p>

<p>Jeremy:  Oh, nothing.  I just don’t think it’s agreeing with me.  Maybe it’s an acquired taste.</p>

<p>Keeley:  Okay, maybe I can whip up something else for you...</p>

<p>Jeremy:  I don’t want to put you to all that trouble.  Sorry to be so fussy.</p>

<p>Keeley:  No, no trouble at all.
<br />...</p>

<p>I like cooking, but with such a picky eater like Jeremy, I might be cooking into next Tuesday!</p>

<p>Mikhail:  What’s all this?</p>

<p>Carol:  It’s open enrollment at my company and I’m thinking of switching health plans.  I have an HMO right now and I’m thinking of switching to a PPO.  That way, I can see doctors outside of my current network and still be covered.</p>

<p>Mikhail:  I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about things like that.  I’m still a dependent on my mother’s plan, at least for another year.</p>

<p>Carol:  Lucky you.  Look at all of this literature!  How am I supposed to make heads or tails of this to compare one plan with another?  </p>

<p>Mikhail:  Wow, yeah, that’s really confusing.  </p>

<p>Carol:  Tell me about it.  I want to know if these new plans have coverage for my pre-existing conditions and prescription drugs, and if not, what the out-of-pocket costs would be.  </p>

<p>Mikhail:  Don’t look at me.  </p>

<p>Carol:  And how am I supposed to figure out what my copay and deductible would be?  </p>

<p>Mikhail:  You’re on your own on this one.  It’s all Greek to me!</p>

      <title>675 - Having Furniture Delivered</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=10142062</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you don’t have a big car or truck, you sometimes need the store to bring the things you bought to your house.  Learn all about furniture delivery in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:21
<br />Explanations: 3:20
<br />Fast dialogue: 17:18</p>

<p>I was waiting patiently for the furniture store to deliver my new bed.  I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00.  At 4:50, the delivery truck pulled up in front of my house.
<br />...</p>

<p>Zuly:  Hello.</p>

<p>Danny:  Hi!  We’re from Reliable Furniture.  We’re here to deliver your new bed.</p>

<p>Zuly:  I thought you’d never get here.  The new bed should go in the bedroom.  Follow me.  You’ll haul away the old bed, right?</p>

<p>Danny:  We will for an extra charge.</p>

<p>Zuly:  I thought that was included in the price of the new bed.</p>

<p>Danny:  Let me check the paperwork.  Oh, I guess it is.  We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one.  </p>

<p>Zuly:  Okay, this way.  You can bring the bed right in here.  </p>

<p>Danny:  Okay, here you are.  We’re all done.</p>

<p>Zuly:  Aren’t you guys going to remove the bubble wrap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?  </p>

<p>Danny:  We can, but it’ll cost extra.</p>

<p>Zuly:  I’m sure that’s included in the price of the new bed.</p>

<p>Danny:  Let me check...Okay, I guess we’ll set it up.  We’re just running a little late, that’s all.  We got a late start from the warehouse this morning and it’s already past quitting time.
<br />...</p>

<p>I wasn’t too happy, to say the least, but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything.  But as soon as they’re finished, I’ll be ready to give them a piece of my mind!</p>

<p>Tania:  Did you see the news today?  Canada has been doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border.  I think they’re trying to send us a message.</p>

<p>Emilio:  They’re just saber-rattling.  They think we’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.  </p>

<p>Tania:  I don’t think they’re just posturing.  </p>

<p>Emilio:  Canada is no real threat.  No one in the government wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty with us.  </p>

<p>Tania:  How can you say that?  All of this military aggression makes me nervous.  If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choice but to retaliate.  Things could escalate very quickly.</p>

<p>Emilio:  That’s why I’m well prepared.</p>

<p>Tania:  Well prepared?  How?</p>

<p>Emilio:  Haven’t you seen me building my underground bunker?  I’ll be safe there if Canada, or anyone else, strikes.</p>

<p>Tania:  An underground bunker?</p>

<p>Emilio:  Yes, and if you ask nicely, I’ll save a place for you.</p>

<p>Reina:  Okay, I’m ready to walk my way to better fitness!</p>

<p>Lars:  I’m glad you’re so enthusiastic about starting to exercise.  </p>

<p>Reina:  I’m totally psyched!  Check out my new tennis shoes.  </p>

<p>Lars:  They’re brand new?  You haven’t broken them in yet?  I hope you don’t get blisters.</p>

<p>Reina:  Stop worrying.  Let’s go, I’m ready to work up a sweat!</p>

<p>Lars:  Wait.  There are a few things you need to know before we start.  It’s a good idea to stretch and to warm up to avoid injuries.</p>

<p>Reina:  I stretched already and as soon as we get started, I’ll warm up slowly.  Let’s go!</p>

<p>Lars:  All right, here we go, nice and slow.</p>

<p>Reina:  Come on!  How are we supposed to increase our heart rate if we walk this slowly?  Pick up the pace!</p>

<p>Lars:  I don’t want to get shin splints.  It’s important that we start slowly and maintain a low-impact workout.</p>

<p>Reina:  Forget it!  I’ll race you.  The last one to the park buys lunch.  Ready, set, go!</p>

<p>Lars:  Wait!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you late finishing your project at work?  Did you not have time to complete your homework at school?  No problem!  You can ask for more time after listening to this episode.</p>

<p>Dan:  Hello.</p>

<p>Marcia:  Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project?  We’re still on schedule, right?</p>

<p>Dan:  Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about that.  We’ve had a slight delay.</p>

<p>Marcia:  What do you mean by “slight”?  Are you saying that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?</p>

<p>Dan:  Not exactly.  I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.  </p>

<p>Marcia:  How short?  </p>

<p>Dan:  A week or two, tops.  We hit a minor snag, but we should have everything up and running in no time.  </p>

<p>Marcia:  If the project has come to a grinding halt, then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.  We’re running on a tight schedule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.  </p>

<p>Dan:  I know that all too well.  </p>

<p>Marcia:  Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.  </p>

<p>Dan:  No, you don’t.  My head is on the chopping block and the clock is ticking.</p>

<p>Mohsen:  I need to get off this island.  I’m getting island fever.</p>

<p>Ella:  We’ve only been here two days.  Give it a chance.  We’re here to enjoy a slower pace of life, remember?</p>

<p>Mohsen:  When you said we were going on an island vacation, I didn’t know we’d be so isolated.  There isn’t a living soul within five miles!</p>

<p>Ella:  This isn’t isolated; it’s secluded.  We have privacy and serenity.  Isn’t that what we wanted?</p>

<p>Mohsen:  I wanted a vacation with all of the creature comforts.</p>

<p>Ella:  That’s what we have, don’t you think?  We’re staying in a very nice house.</p>

<p>Mohsen:  Yes, but what about the creature comforts?  I have no Internet access and no cell phone service.  This is what I call roughing it.  </p>

<p>Ella:  We agreed that we both needed a little time away to unwind.  The whole point of this vacation is for us to relax.</p>

<p>Mohsen:  I’m cut off from civilization and I have no access to email and my favorite websites.  What could be more stressful than this?!</p>

<p>Luc:  You’ll never guess who called and left a voicemail message today.</p>

<p>Angela:  Who?</p>

<p>Luc:  Barbara!</p>

<p>Angela:  Oh, really?  What did she want?</p>

<p>Luc:  She said she was calling to RSVP for our party this Saturday.</p>

<p>Angela:  Did she? </p>

<p>Luc:  Stop playing innocent with me.  Did you or did you not invite her to our party this Saturday?</p>

<p>Angela:  I may have.  Okay, I did.</p>

<p>Luc:  Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t you and Barbara have a knock-down, drag-out fight last month?</p>

<p>Angela:  We may have.</p>

<p>Luc:  And didn’t you say that you’d never speak to her again much less invite her over to our house?</p>

<p>Angela:  That’s water under the bridge.  You know what they say:  “To err is human, to forgive divine.”</p>

<p>Luc:  I can’t believe my ears.  You ranted and raved for days that you’d hold against her for the rest of your life all of the terrible things she said about you.  </p>

<p>Angela:  I was being overdramatic.  I don’t think I ranted and raved, actually.  We just had a little spat.  It’s best just to forgive and forget.</p>

<p>Luc:  Unbelievable!  Why can’t you have a selective memory when we have fights?  </p>

<p>Vivian:  Her opinion is offensive.  Mark my words: Before the end of the week, a lot of people will be up in arms calling for her head on a platter.</p>

<p>Vivian:  No way.  She’ll never get away with it.  </p>

<p>Kylie:  I’ve just crunched the numbers and we’re not going to be able to meet payroll next month because of cash flow problems.  </p>

<p>Miguel:  That can’t be.  The cash flow projections from last month showed that we’d be fine.</p>

<p>Kylie:  We didn’t anticipate a shortfall in income this month and didn’t set aside enough cash to hedge against a cash flow problem.</p>

<p>Miguel:  What can we do?  We need a stopgap solution now. </p>

<p>Kylie:  Well, we could try to extend our line of credit at the bank.  </p>

<p>Miguel:  We’re already overextended at the bank.  I don’t want to push our luck.</p>

<p>Kylie:  The other option is to hold off on paying our suppliers and hope that our income goes up next month, as predicted.</p>

<p>Miguel:  Do you really think we can hold them off for that long?  </p>

<p>Kylie:  I’ll have a talk with our biggest suppliers and give them assurances that they’ll get paid.  Let’s just hope they’re not having cash flow problems of their own!</p>

Miguel:  What can we do?  We need a stopgap solution now.

Kylie:  Well, we could try to extend our line of credit at the bank.

Miguel:  We’re already overextended at the bank.  I don’t want to push our luck.

Kylie:  The other option is to hold off on paying our suppliers and hope that our income goes up next month, as predicted.

Miguel:  Do you really think we can hold them off for that long?

Kylie:  I’ll have a talk with our biggest suppliers and give them assurances that they’ll get paid.  Let’s just hope they’re not having cash flow problems of their own!

<p>Randal:  Hurry up.  Rob will be here any minute.</p>

<p>Marjorie:  I can’t remember the combination to this lock.  </p>

<p>Randal:  I thought you knew it by heart.</p>

<p>Marjorie:  It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t seem to remember the last two digits.  It’s 73 or 63 or 38...</p>

<p>Randal:  You said you had it down cold!</p>

<p>Marjorie:  I do know it, but it’s just slipped my mind.  I’ll figure it out.  I used a mnemonic to remember those last two digits.  I just need to jog my memory.  The last digits have to do with my birthday, or is it Rob’s birthday... </p>

<p>Randal:  I only let you in on this little joke we’re going to play on Rob because you said you knew the combination to the lock on his bike.  I should have known you were lying through your teeth.</p>

<p>Marjorie:  I wasn’t lying.  I really do know it.  If you’ll just stop talking so I can concentrate...</p>

<p>Randal:  Too late.  Here comes Rob.  Run for your life, if you know what’s good for you!</p>

<p>Vanessa:  Put away that guidebook.  I want our vacation to be exciting and unique, not cookie cutter.  Tourists all visit the same sites.  I want to explore and go to some places off the beaten path.</p>

<p>Justin:  That would be fine except we’ve never traveled to Podville before and we don’t speak the language.  How are we going to make our way around if we don’t plan out our trip?</p>

<p>Vanessa:  We’ll be fine.  Stop worrying.  We spend too much time planning.  Let’s just fly by the seat of our pants.  </p>

<p>Justin:  You really want to just go unprepared?  That’s just not sensible.  Anything could happen.</p>

<p>Vanessa:  I’m not going to lose sleep over it.  We just need to meet some locals and they’ll be able to tell us about the hidden, secluded, and offbeat sites.  Those are the ones I want to see.</p>

<p>Justin:  You can explore all you like, but I’m bringing some insurance.  </p>

<p>Vanessa:  What insurance?  </p>

<p>Justin:  I’m bringing two guidebooks and this phone number.</p>

<p>Vanessa:  Phone number for what?</p>

<p>Justin:  The phone number for the American embassy.  That’s where I plan to go for help when you get lost off the beaten path!</p>

<p>Geraldo:  I want a good sandwich, maybe a BLT or a pastrami on rye.  Now that I think of it, a Reuben or a club sandwich would really hit the spot.  I wonder if Nathan’s is still open.  </p>

<p>Natasha:  I doubt it.  It’s really late.</p>

<p>Geraldo:  In that case, maybe we can find a diner where I can get a French dip or a cheesesteak sandwich.  I’d even settle for a tuna or chicken salad sandwich.</p>

<p>Natasha:  The nearest diner is closed for renovations, remember?  </p>

<p>Geraldo:  What are we going to do?</p>

<p>Natasha:  I know of a place that’s open and ready to serve.</p>

<p>Geraldo:  Where?</p>

<p>Natasha:  My place.</p>

<p>Geraldo:  You can make me a good sandwich?</p>

<p>Natasha:  You’ll have a choice of grilled cheese or peanut butter and jelly.  What do you say?</p>

<p>Geraldo:  I guess beggars can’t be choosers.</p>

      <title>664 - Preparing a Video Resume</title>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:20
<br />Explanations: 3:45
<br />Fast dialogue: 18:43</p>

<p>Katrina:  Okay, I’m ready to hear all of your advice about what to put into a video resume.</p>

<p>Raj:  All right.  The first thing to remember is that your video resume doesn’t take the place of your traditional resume; it supplements it.  </p>

<p>Katrina:  Okay, I got it.  I was thinking of talking about some of my outside interests and activities to show that I’m a well-rounded person.</p>

<p>Raj:  I’d forget about that, if I were you.  The point of the video resume is to make a good business impression.  It’s not about showing your outside skills or interests. You’re marketing yourself as a business professional so you should wear business attire, something you would wear to an interview. </p>

<p>Katrina:  Oh, so this outfit is out, I guess.  I wanted to show them my personality.</p>

<p>Raj:  I think that outfit would definitely knock you out of contention for any job.  You have to get it out of your head that you’re going to get hired for your personality or charm.  What counts are your qualifications, your skills, and how you handle yourself in a business setting.  </p>

<p>Katrina:  Oh, I was afraid you were going to say that.  </p>

<p>Raj:  Stop selling yourself short.  Your qualifications and skills are as good as the next guy’s.  You just have to believe in yourself.</p>

<p>Katrina:  Right, I have to believe in myself...I have to believe in myself.  Hey, I think I can do it! </p>

<p>Raj:  Really?  You think you can produce a video resume that’s professional and polished?</p>

<p>Katrina:  Sure, it should be no problem.  I know just the right person to hire as a stand-in!</p>

<p>Vagner:  Aren’t you supposed to be studying for the driver’s test?  </p>

<p>Liesl:  I’m supposed to be, but I keep getting distracted.  Reading this manual is deadly.</p>

<p>Vagner:  I know, but if you don’t study, you’ll never pass the test.  Try to focus.</p>

<p>Liesl:  I’ve tried to keep my mind on the rules of the road, but I’m having trouble concentrating.  My mind keeps wandering and I’m almost ready to throw in the towel for today.  </p>

<p>Vagner:  No, you can’t do that.  You have to buckle down and learn what’s in this manual.  I’m here to crack the whip. </p>

<p>Liesl:  What’s in it for you?  What do you care if I pass the driver’s test or not? </p>

<p>Vagner:  You can ask me that?  I’ve been chauffeuring you around since I got my driver’s license and I don’t plan on doing it for one second more than I have to.</p>

<p>Liesl:  All right, all right, I’ll study, but not because you’re telling me to.</p>

<p>Vagner:  Oh, yeah?  Then why?</p>

      <title>662 - Doctor-Patient Confidentiality</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9943202</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Can you trust your doctor to keep a secret?  Find out in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:26
<br />Explanations: 3:32
<br />Fast dialogue: 18:27</p>

<p>Dr. Green:  Can I consult you on a case of medical ethics?</p>

<p>Dr. Hause:  Sure, I’m not a lawyer, but I can give you my opinion as another doctor.</p>

<p>Dr. Green:  That’s what I’m looking for, your honest opinion.  I have a patient who has a medical condition that can be spread to her family, but she doesn’t want to tell them about it.  I don’t want to breach doctor-patient confidentiality, but I think that at least her husband should know.</p>

<p>Dr. Hause:  That’s a tricky one.  We both know that the only way we can get our patients to divulge any sensitive information is if they trust us.  We can’t easily put aside that confidentiality.  </p>

<p>Dr. Green:  I know, but if she doesn’t tell her family, then they are in danger of developing serious medical problems themselves.  I took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm.  How can I keep her secret and adhere to the spirit of that oath?</p>

<p>Dr. Hause:  I see what you mean.  If I were you, I’d sit my patient down and tell her what you think her responsibilities are to her family.  Maybe you can convince her to tell them.</p>

<p>Dr. Green:  I’ve tried talking to her already, and she didn’t want to listen.  I’ll try again.  But what if she doesn’t agree?  </p>

<p>Dr. Hause:  Then you can either drop it, tell her family, or...</p>

<p>Dr. Green:  Or what?  </p>

<p>Dr. Hause:  Hope your patient has a miraculous recovery.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Be careful not to hurt yourself at work.  If you do, then listen to this episode to find out how to talk about it in English.</p>

<br />Fast dialogue: 17:50</p>

<p>Darrelle:  I just went to a seminar about work-related injuries.  I really have to rethink my workspace.</p>

<p>Kim:  Work-related injuries?  It’s not like we’re doing heavy lifting every day.  We sit at our desks all day.</p>

<p>Darrelle:  That’s the problem.  Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard.  Poor posture can cause a lot of problems over time.  Aren’t you always complaining about back pain?  </p>

<p>Kim:  Yeah, but…</p>

<p>Darrelle:  And look at how you squint at your computer monitor all day.  Aren’t you always complaining about headaches?  You’re probably suffering from eye strain. </p>

<p>Kim:  It’s true that I sometimes have headaches.</p>

<p>Darrelle:  It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day, repetitive motion after repetitive motion.  Aren’t you suffering from elbow pain right now?</p>

<p>Kim:  I was this morning…</p>

<p>Darrelle:  See what I mean?  We need better ergonomics in this office.  </p>

<p>Kim:  Okay, where do we start?</p>

<p>Darrelle:  I think we need to sign up for a seminar on how to prevent work-related injuries.</p>

<p>Kim:  What do you have in mind?</p>

<p>Darrelle:  How about this four-day seminar?</p>

<p>Kim:  But that seminar is in Florida.</p>

<p>Darrelle:  What better way to recover from any work-related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida?</p>

<p>Kim:  Count me in!</p>

<p>Tony:  Another Valentine’s Day!  I really hate Valentine’s Day.  </p>

<p>Chelsea:  What’s your problem?  </p>

<p>Tony:  I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes, stuffed animals, and cupid decorations everywhere.  Lovey-dovey couples on the street and nothing but sentimental movies on TV – that’s what I have a problem with.  </p>

<p>Chelsea:  You’re just jaded because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.</p>

<p>Tony:  Do you blame me?  This is the third year I’m spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jaded.  </p>

<p>Chelsea:  There are plenty of women you could go out with.  Just open your eyes and look around.</p>

<p>Tony:  All of the women I know are either psycho or attached.  I’ve given up on dating.  </p>

<p>Chelsea:  How will you find a Miss Right with an attitude like that?</p>

<p>Tony:  I’ve told you.  I’ve given up.</p>

<p>Chelsea:  Well, I think you should open your eyes.  Your valentine may be right under your nose!</p>

<br />Fast dialogue: 14:22</p>

<p>Adelia:  When I created this writing contest, I had no idea that we would get so many entries.  </p>

<p>Omar:  Good thing you have an impartial panel of judges to help you select the winner.</p>

<p>Adelia:  Yes, good thing.  I’m really grateful to all of you for giving up your time to help.  </p>

<p>Omar:  What criteria are we using to score each of the entries?  </p>

<p>Adelia:  We’re using a 10-point scale.  Each of us will read an entry and give it a score.  When we’re all done, we’ll average out those scores.  Hopefully, there’ll be a clear winner.</p>

<p>Omar:  And if not?</p>

<p>Adelia:  If there isn’t, then we’ll take the top scorers and vote on which is best.  Majority rules.</p>

<p>Omar:  Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifying an entry?  For instance, what if somebody didn’t follow the entry guidelines?</p>

<p>Adelia:  I’ve already culled the entries for the ones that don’t meet the requirements.  These are all eligible.</p>

<p>Omar:  Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our work cut out for us.</p>

<p>Adelia:  You’ve got that right.</p>

Omar:  What criteria are we using to score each of the entries?

Adelia:  We’re using a 10-point scale.  Each of us will read an entry and give it a score.  When we’re all done, we’ll average out those scores.  Hopefully, there’ll be a clear winner.

Omar:  And if not?

Adelia:  If there isn’t, then we’ll take the top scorers and vote on which is best.  Majority rules.

Omar:  Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifying an entry?  For instance, what if somebody didn’t follow the entry guidelines?

Adelia:  I’ve already culled the entries for the ones that don’t meet the requirements.  These are all eligible.

Omar:  Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our work cut out for us.

Adelia:  You’ve got that right.

<p>Marianne:  I don’t understand it.  I got a notice from the bank that two of my checks bounced.  I’ve never had an overdraft in my life.</p>

<p>Jae:  That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re always so careful with your money.</p>

<p>Marianne:  I am!  I don’t understand what happened.</p>

<p>Jae:  Let me take a look at your bank statement.  Okay, here are your deposits and withdrawals from last month.  Did you know that your bank charges you a fee just to have a checking account?</p>

<p>Marianne:  It does?  I didn’t know that.</p>

<p>Jae:  It looks like you also have a minimum balance requirement.  If you fall below that, you get charged a fee.</p>

<p>Marianne:  I do?</p>

<p>Jae:  If it’s like my checking account, you can avoid that by getting direct deposit for your paycheck.  Did you also know that you get charged every time you use your ATM card to make a purchase?</p>

<p>Marianne:  I didn’t know that!</p>

<p>Jae:  Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is charging you fees for all of those things and after those fees were deducted, you were left with less money in your account than you thought.</p>

<p>Marianne:  That’s so sneaky!  How could they do that?</p>

<p>Jae:  They count on you not reading the terms and conditions and not looking closely at your statements.</p>

<p>Marianne:  I’ve had it!  I’m moving banks.  I’m taking my business elsewhere.</p>

<p>Jae:  Oh, yeah?  I know of a good bank.</p>

<p>Marianne:  You do?</p>

<p>Jae:  Sure, it’s called the Bank of Jae.  No fees – ever. </p>

<p>Marianne:  Yes, but would I ever see my money again?</p>

<p>Jermaine:  How did the investor meeting go?</p>

<p>Teresa:  That meeting has been postponed until next week.  One of the potential investors is out of town.</p>

<p>Jermaine:  In that case, can you help me with some of this work?</p>

<p>Teresa:  I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.</p>

<p>Jermaine:  Stationery?  You’re ordering stationery?</p>

<p>Teresa:  Yes, of course.  For us to be taken seriously as a new company, we have to project a professional image.  Having good stationery is part of that.</p>

<p>Jermaine:  I’m not sure...</p>

<p>Teresa:  Look, we can’t go to business meetings without good business cards, right?</p>

<p>Jermaine:  I guess so...</p>

<p>Teresa:  If we have any correspondence with our potential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?</p>

<p>Jermaine:  Whoa!  Aren’t you jumping the gun?</p>

<p>Teresa:  Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Jermaine:  First, we need to establish a company, and then we can start behaving like one.</p>

<p>Teresa:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If you build it, they will come.</p>

<p>Jermaine:  You mean if we start behaving like a company, then the investors will come?</p>

<p>Teresa:  Precisely!</p>

      <title>655 - Staying in a Vacation Rental</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You don’t always need to stay in a hotel when you go on vacation.  Learn about renting someone else’s house instead in this episode.</p>

<br />Fast dialogue: 17:36</p>

<p>George:  I’m kind of nervous staying in a vacation rental for the first time.</p>

<p>Marnie:  Don’t worry.  Before I booked this unit, I checked it out thoroughly.  It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly, and it sleeps six, so it’ll be perfect for the whole family.</p>

<p>George:  But there won’t be the same amenities or services as a hotel.</p>

<p>Marnie:  We won’t need any of those.  Just think, we’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoining units.  The proximity to town is great and I got a last-minute price that’s even lower than their low season rate.</p>

<p>George:  Everything sounds good, but…</p>

<p>Marnie:  It’ll be our home away from home. Units this close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.</p>

<p>George:  A little too affordable, if you ask me.  You said that it’s just $60 a night?</p>

<p>Marnie:  That’s right.</p>

<p>George:  Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?</p>

<p>Marnie:  I didn’t ask about that.</p>

<p>George:  Do they require a refundable deposit?</p>

<p>Marnie:  I didn’t check that either.</p>

<p>George:  Then maybe it’s too good to be true.  Before we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.</p>

<p>Delilah:  Could you turn your music down?</p>

<p>Josh:  Oh, sure.  Is there a problem?</p>

<p>Delilah:  No, there’s no problem.  I was just trying to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it hard to concentrate.</p>

<p>Josh:  Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud.  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.  The volume control is in the same place it always is, not one decibel higher.</p>

<p>Delilah:  That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.  And what was that banging sound?</p>

<p>Josh:  Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my chair.  I’m done.  </p>

<p>Delilah:  And what was that thumping noise?</p>

<p>Josh:  Thumping noise?  Oh, I was lifting weights and dropping them back down on the floor.  </p>

      <title>653 - Reading Product Reviews</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Try it before you buy it – or, if you can’t try it, at least read what other people think about that new TV you want to buy.  Learn all about product reviews in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:23

<br />Fast dialogue: 14:36</p>

<p>Dominic:  Do you want some help with that box?</p>

<p>Andrea:  Sure, thanks.  </p>

<p>Dominic:  What is it?  </p>

<p>Andrea:  It’s a new TV.  My old one has been on the fritz for a week and I needed a new one.  </p>

<p>Dominic:  Is this a highly-rated model?  </p>

<p>Andrea:  Highly-rated?  I just went to the electronics store and bought it.  It was on sale.</p>

<p>Dominic:  You mean you didn’t read up on it before you bought it?  You didn’t look at the reviews?</p>

<p>Andrea:  No, I never do that.  I think that’s a waste of time.  I go with my gut.</p>

<p>Dominic:  But if you read the reviews, you’ll know which product gives you the best value, which is the most reliable and durable, and which company has good customer support.  Nobody wants to buy something that’s defective or poorly designed.  Don’t you care about those things?</p>

<p>Andrea:  Maybe, but who has time to do that?  Instead, I go to the store and see which one I like overall.  If it’s on sale, that’s all the better.  That’s worked for me so far.</p>

<p>Dominic:  Is that how you bought your old TV?</p>

<p>Andrea:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Dominic:  Enough said.</p>

Andrea:  No, I never do that.  I think that’s a waste of time.  I go with my gut.

Dominic:  But if you read the reviews, you’ll know which product gives you the best value, which is the most reliable and durable, and which company has good customer support.  Nobody wants to buy something that’s defective or poorly designed.  Don’t you care about those things?

Andrea:  Maybe, but who has time to do that?  Instead, I go to the store and see which one I like overall.  If it’s on sale, that’s all the better.  That’s worked for me so far.

Dominic:  Is that how you bought your old TV?

Andrea:  Yeah.

Dominic:  Enough said.

      <title>652 - Outdoor Advertising</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9794057</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The world needs more advertising, don’t you think?  No?  Well, find out about it anyway in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:06
<br />Explanations: 2:54
<br />Fast dialogue: 17:19</p>

<p>Kam:  Okay, the purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advertising campaign.  Gina, take it away.</p>

<p>Gina:  Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk today about outdoor advertising.  I know that it’s a new area for us and it hasn’t been on our radar in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.</p>

<p>Kam:  Can we talk specifics?</p>

<p>Gina:  Sure.  There are several types of outdoor advertising.  One is the billboard, both the traditional kind and the digital ones.  Advertising on ones in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.  To get even more exposure all over town, we can use mobile advertising.</p>

<p>Kam:  You mean advertise on buses?</p>

<p>Gina:  Yes, more and more, products are being advertised on buses and cars.  These wraps can also be put on the side of buildings and other structures. There really are a lot of outdoor advertising options, from bench ads to skywriting.</p>

<p>Kam:  That’s all very interesting, but which of these methods do you recommend?</p>

<p>Gina:  I think we should use all of them – blanket the city with our new ads.  </p>

<p>Kam:  All of them?  </p>

<p>Gina:  Yes, all of them.  You know what they say:  “Go big or go home.”</p>

      <title>651 - Psychological Disorders</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9784114</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>No one needs therapy more than a psychologist...I mean, a psychologist's patient.  Learn how to talk about common psychological disorders in English in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:17
<br />Explanations: 3:42
<br />Fast dialogue: 16:05</p>

<p>Brett:  Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a few minutes?</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  Certainly.  Have a seat.</p>

<p>Brett:  I’m really enjoying your psychology class and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  Sure, go ahead.</p>

<p>Brett:  Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especially around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  It’s hard to say without knowing your friend, but he may have an anxiety disorder or some type of phobia.</p>

<p>Brett:  I was afraid of that.  Well, I have another friend who has mood swings all the time and washes his hands 50 times a day.  </p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  Again, I don’t know your friend so it’s hard to make a diagnosis, but he may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obsessive-compulsive.</p>

<p>Brett:  That sounds really serious.  Well, I have another friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire.  That’s bad, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  It could be.  Your friend may have an eating disorder and his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania, but it’s very hard to say.</p>

<p>Brett:  Did I mention that he likes to steal things, too?</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  People who feel compelled to steal may have kleptomania.  Who are all of these friends you’re talking about?  Do I know them?</p>

<p>Brett:  No, definitely not.</p>

<p>Dr. Mollie:  Hmm, would your “friends” like to make an appointment with a therapist?  It sounds like it may be a good idea.</p>

<p>Brett:  No, no.  My “friends” wouldn’t like that.  He has a real fear of doctors.</p>

      <title>650 - Buying Television and Movie Programs</title>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:15
<br />Explanations: 3:07
<br />Fast dialogue: 16:50</p>

<p>Cameron:  What did you get for Christmas?</p>

<p>James:  I got a box set of my favorite TV show of all time, the McQ Files.  It contains all five seasons of the show, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  I can’t wait to watch it all!</p>

<p>Cameron:  Didn’t you see the entire series when it was shown on TV?</p>

<p>James:  I did, but the bonus features make it a must-have for a big fan like me.  </p>

<p>Cameron:  I just don’t see why people spend good money buying shows they’ve already seen. </p>

<p>James:  Hey, wait a second.  Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy box set when it went on sale last month?</p>

<p>Cameron:  Uh, yeah, but that’s different.  Those are movies, not TV shows.  The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and commentary, not to mention never-before-released scenes.  </p>

<p>James:  Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters?</p>

<p>Cameron:  Yes, but…</p>

<p>James:  And don’t you own all three movies on video already?</p>

<p>Cameron:  Well, maybe I do but…</p>

<p>James:  Then I don’t see why you needed to buy the box set.  I think it’s best that you give it to me.</p>

<p>Cameron:  Touché.</p>

<p>Andy:  You did?  I didn’t get that impression at all.  I don’t know what Brian sees in her.    </p>

<p>Georgia:  Really?  I thought she was really trying to make a good impression.</p>

<p>Andy:  Yeah, she was trying <u>too</u> hard.  She laughed too loudly at my jokes and complimented you too much on your cooking.</p>

<p>Georgia:  Maybe she was a little too eager, but that just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wrong with that?</p>

<p>Andy:  Nothing is wrong with that, but did you see how clingy she was?  She wouldn’t leave Brian’s side for a minute, spoke for him, and finished his sentences.  I just found that really annoying.  </p>

<p>Georgia:  Brian didn’t seem to mind and that’s what really counts.  Maybe he likes having an attentive girlfriend.</p>

<p>Andy:  There’s attentive and there’s smothering.  She just seemed really possessive, that’s all.</p>

<p>Georgia:  Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much.  </p>

<p>Andy:  What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Georgia:  I think you might like Carla a little too much for your own good.  Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girlfriend.</p>

<p>Andy:  Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that I didn’t like her at all?</p>

<p>Georgia:  Yes, but you said it with such passion!</p>

<p>Irene:  What kind of job is it?  </p>

<p>Dennis:  I’ll be working strictly on commission.  The more I sell, the more I earn.  It’s a great opportunity for someone with my talents in sales.</p>

<p>Irene:  I know you’re great at sales and I’m sure you’ll do well, but you can’t coast in a job based on commissions.  You’ll have work really, really hard.</p>

<p>Dennis:  I’m not worried.  For me, selling is second nature. I’ll barely have to lift a finger and the profits will come rolling in.</p>

<p>Irene:  But isn’t your paycheck going to be in flux all the time?  You’ll never know what your take-home pay will be.  </p>

<p>Dennis:  There’s no cap on how much I can earn, so the sky’s the limit.  </p>

<p>Irene:  That’s not exactly what I meant.  Some weeks, it may be hard to live on what you earn, don’t you think?</p>

<p>Dennis:  What?  Do I hear a hint of uncertainty in your voice?  </p>

<p>Irene:  No, it’s just that...</p>

<p>Dennis:  Put your mind at ease.  I could sell ice to Alaskans!</p>

<p>Hitomi:  Every feature?</p>

<p>Jason:  It has a high quality camera and video camera, and it’s a videophone.  It has a great GPS program, too.  The touch-screen and the keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  Even a child could use it.</p>

<p>Hitomi:  Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensive price tag, right?  </p>

<p>Jason:  True enough, but it has a removable SIM card and is Bluetooth compatible.  I can even use it as an e-book reader, and download apps for just about anything I want to do.  No child’s toy could do all of those things.</p>

<p>Hitomi:  Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.</p>

<p>Jason:  What?</p>

<p>Hitomi:  Can you make a telephone call on it?</p>

<p>Elena:  How do you like your new job at the Veteran’s Hospital?</p>

<p>Wieland:  I like it a lot.  It’s really rewarding.  </p>

<p>Elena:  What do you do there, exactly?</p>

<p>Wieland:  My job is to help returning vets who have been physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.</p>

<p>Elena:  You mean people who have lost limbs?</p>

<p>Wieland:  Yes, some of the vets have had one or more limbs amputated.  But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the hospital.  For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.  </p>

<p>Elena:  It sounds like a very hard job.</p>

<p>Wieland:  It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes.  I’ve seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives.  With the help of wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, seeing-eye dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilities can learn to be independent.  That’s part of my job.</p>

<p>Elena:  Then you’re just the person I need to help my brother.  </p>

<p>Wieland:  Is he disabled?</p>

<p>Elena:  Yes, he has a serious case of paralysis, cause by extreme laziness.  Is there any help for him?</p>

      <title>645 - Shaving Your Face</title>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:09

<br />Fast dialogue: 16:53</p>

<p>I forgot to set my alarm last night and I woke up later than usual.  I was tempted to skip my morning shave, but I hate having long stubble all day.  I like to be clean-shaven every day.  I’m the kind of guy who gets a five-o’clock shadow early in the afternoon, so if I skipped my morning shave, I’d look like I was growing a beard by the end of the day.</p>

<p>I went into the bathroom and picked up my shaving cream.  I lathered up my face and checked to see that my razor was sharp and that I didn’t need to replace the razor blades.  There’s nothing worse than trying to shave with a dull razor.  I tried using an electric razor for a while, but I could never get a close enough shave.</p>

<p>I tried to focus on shaving my neck, chin, and cheeks.  I was in too much of a hurry, though, and nicked myself on the neck.  I hate it when that happens!  I knew I was in too much of a hurry, but I was going to be really late.  Oh, I did it again!  This time I nicked myself on the chin.  “Okay,” I said to myself, “slow down.  You’d rather be a little late to work than to end up with a face full of potholes, right?”</p>

Bill:  The world is being ruled by liberals, at least by the liberal press.

Rachel:  You’ve got to be kidding!  Our politics and our financial system are run by staunch conservatives, who ignore any point of view other than their own.  Those of us who are enlightened...

Bill:  You call yourselves enlightened?  All you and your dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to do is to tear down old traditions.

Rachel:  Yes, we do want to tear down old traditions, old traditions that keep us from making progress toward...

Sophia:  Mom, Dad, what’s going on in here?  Why are you yelling?

Rachel:  Oh, it’s nothing, honey.  Go back to sleep.  Your Dad and I are just having a friendly little talk.

<br />Fast dialogue: 18:22</p>

<p>Vern:  I really think we’ve bitten off more than we can chew.  I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door isn’t as easy as it looks.  </p>

<p>Genevive:  What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.  Okay, we’ve removed the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be great and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.  We just need to put in a new frame first, and then we can move it into place.</p>

<p>Vern:  You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to fit?  It looks too big.</p>

<p>Genevive:  Oh sure, it’ll fit.  </p>

<p>Vern:  This latch doesn’t seem to be working.</p>

<p>Genevive:  It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give me a hand.  Hmm...the new window doesn’t seem to fit exactly.  I’m not sure what the problem is.  Let me think about it.  Let’s move on to the door and come back to it later.</p>

<p>Vern:  Are you sure?  </p>

<p>Genevive:  Sure, I’m sure.  Installing the new door will be easier and we can get it out of the way.</p>

<p>Vern:  Maybe we should wait until the window is installed.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall, it’ll be a very cold night in the house.
<br />
<br />Genevive:  Don’t worry.  Let’s see, first we have to remove the old door without damaging the jamb.  The hinges are rusted; it seems to be stuck.  Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.</p>

<p>Vern:  See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as easy as you thought, is it?</p>

<p>Genevive:  I got it off in the end, didn’t I?</p>

<p>Vern:  Yes, but will you be able to put in the new one before I die of frostbite?</p>

<p>Paulo:  Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.</p>

<p>Server:  Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you like?  We have chicken noodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.  </p>

<p>Paulo:  Do you have something that’s hearty?</p>

<p>Server:  If you want something hearty, I would suggest our clam chowder or beef stew.</p>

<p>Paulo:  I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.</p>

<p>Server:  Great!  What kind of salad would you like: a chef salad, Caesar salad, or Cobb salad?</p>

<p>Server:  Okay, what kind of dressing would you like?</p>

<p>Paulo:  What kind do you have?</p>

<p>Server:  We have French, Italian, ranch, Thousand Island, and vinaigrette.  </p>

<p>Server:  Oh yes, I forgot to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew and a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?</p>

<p>Rebecca:  No, but I’m really glad there’s a fire station only a few blocks away.  Hey look, there’s the fire engine.  Here come the firefighters!</p>

<p>Hugh:  Yeah, let’s get back to work.  I’m sure they’ll have the blaze under control pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Rebecca:  How can you work with all of this excitement?  Maybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upstairs to help.</p>

<p>Hugh:  I think that’s a really bad idea.  You can see for yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire.  They’re getting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant.  Anyway, it’s probably just a false alarm.</p>

<p>Rebecca:  If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure there’s a fire.  We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes coming down.</p>

<p>Hugh:  I’ve never seen you like this before.  Why are you so excited?</p>

<p>Rebecca:  I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up.  I’ve always had a fascination with fire.</p>

<p>Hugh:  Ah, that explains it.  Would it make you feel better if I lit up a cigarette?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are good at gardening, we say you have a green thumb.  Get your green thumb on in this episode that will explain how we talk about flowers and trees.</p>

<br />Fast dialogue: 16:47</p>

<p>Zuly:  Hurry up!  Mom will be home any minute and we’re not done planting.</p>

<p>Eric:  Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for Mom for her birthday?  We’ve been working under this hot sun all day and the smell of the fertilizer is really getting to me.</p>

<p>Zuly:  It was our idea, remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Look, we’re almost done.  We’ve already picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them in the ground in a minute.  After that, all we have left to do is to plant the new tree.  Keep digging!</p>

<p>Eric:  Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?</p>

<p>Zuly:  Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room to grow.  That’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get a lot of direct sunlight.  </p>

<p>Eric:  Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about to fall off.</p>

<p>Zuly:  Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you water the new flowers?</p>

<p>Eric:  Sure, right after I take a little break.  In the meantime, I’ll supervise.  Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re almost there...</p>

<p>Zuly:  I think you’d better keep your mouth shut, or I’ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!</p>

<p>Carmen:  Out of it?  You’re sleeping on the job – literally!  </p>

<p>Elias:  So what?  Aren’t you feeling a little tired on a Monday morning?</p>

<p>Carmen:  I admit I’m a little sluggish, but that’s no reason to fall down on the job.  We both have work to get done and I’m doing it.</p>

<p>Elias:  What’s wrong with you?  Why are you so hyper?  I’m as hard working as the next guy, but I’m not going to jump through hoops when the boss is away.  </p>

<p>Carmen:  You, hard working?  Don’t make me laugh!  You’d better get back to work or when the boss gets back, he’ll call you a slacker again.</p>

<p>Elias:  Okay, I’m learning by your example.  I’m now as energetic and productive as you are.  </p>

<p>Carmen:  Yeah?  Doing what?</p>

      <title>635 - Arranging Airport Transfer</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9545482</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You have your airplane ticket.  You have your hotel reservation.  Now how are you going to get from the airport to the hotel?  Learn how to find out in English in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:07
<br />Explanations: 3:30
<br />Fast dialogue: 17:39</p>

<p>My wife and I bought a vacation package and we thought that it included everything.  We should have double-checked that it included airport transfer to our hotel as well.  Hindsight is 20/20, they say.</p>

<p>My wife wanted to take a taxi, but I nixed that idea.  It would cost an arm and a leg.  I wanted a cheaper option so we went to ask about it at the airport information desk.
<br />...</p>

<p>Don:  Hello, my wife and I need to get to our hotel downtown.  What are our options?</p>

<p>Clerk:  Well, you could take a taxi.</p>

<p>Don:  We’re hoping to find a cheaper option.  </p>

<p>Clerk:  Okay, in that case, a limo service would be out, too.  There are private shuttle services, but since you’re so far from downtown, you’ll be making a lot of stops and it will take a long time to get there.  You could also take public transportation – the bus or the subway – but that’ll take even longer.  Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?</p>

<p>Don:  I never thought of that.  </p>

<p>Clerk:  Many downtown hotels do.  Call your hotel and they’ll be able to tell you.  They’ll probably have the best suggestion on how to get there, too, if they don’t have their own shuttle.  If you decide on a private shuttle service or to take public transportation, come back and I’ll give you more information.</p>

<p>Don:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll give the hotel a call right now.
<br />...</p>

<p>Lucky for us, the hotel had a courtesy shuttle and it was on its way.  Good thing, too, since I didn’t relish spending any more time at the airport after a long red-eye!</p>

<p>Khaled:  Hi, what are you looking at?</p>

<p>Susanna:  Your photo albums.  Your roommate let me in and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.</p>

<p>Khaled:  There are some really incriminating pictures in there.  You’d better give those back to me.</p>

<p>Susanna:  Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures and your family portraits.  You’re the spitting image of your mother.  </p>

<p>Khaled:  That’s not my mother.  That was our neighbor.  </p>

<p>Susanna:  Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.  You’re a chip off the old block.</p>

<p>Khaled:  That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s friend.  Now, why don’t I take those...</p>

<p>Susanna:  Wait!  These candids of your birthday parties are so cute!  You were so adorable!</p>

<p>Khaled:  Right.  When I was a kid, I had a face only a mother could love.</p>

<p>Susanna:  That’s not true!  You have a great profile.  I’d expect to see your likeness in paintings and on statues.</p>

<p>Khaled:  Okay, enough with the brown-nosing.  What do you really want?</p>

<p>Susanna:  I don’t want anything...okay, just one little thing.  My cousin is in town.  I want to go out with Rick tonight and I thought we could double date.  Me, Rick, my cousin...and you.  What do you say?</p>

<p>Khaled:  I knew it had to be something.  Does she look like you?</p>

<p>[A knock on door.]</p>

<p>Andre:  Hello.  Is anyone here?</p>

<p>Ellie:  Yes, can I help you?</p>

<p>Andre:  I saw your door open and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.  Did you just move in?</p>

<p>Ellie:  No, I’m moving out.  As you can see, I’m doing last-minute packing.  I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!</p>

<p>Andre:  This looks like a major undertaking.  Are you moving yourself?  </p>

<p>Ellie:  No, the movers are coming with the moving van tomorrow morning.  I’m moving a few things into storage, and I’ll take a few of the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doing the heavy lifting.  No loading for me.  Before they come, though, I need to disassemble this desk and this bookcase.  It’ll be a long afternoon. </p>

<p>Andre:  I can see that.  Are you moving far?</p>

<p>Ellie:  No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to another apartment.  </p>

<p>Andre:  Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area.</p>

<p>Ellie:  No, I’m not.</p>

<p>Andre:  I’m glad to hear that.  Let’s make a deal: I’ll help you disassemble your furniture if you’ll promise to invite me over to your new place sometime.</p>

<p>Ellie:  Really?  Are you sure you’re willing to do that?</p>

<p>Andre:  Sure.  Hand me those tools and I’ll have it done in no time.</p>

<p>Ellie:  Boy, am I glad I left my door open.</p>

<p>Andre:  Yeah, so am I.</p>

<p>Keiko:  The layout of your webpage is so lame.  Why don’t you customize it?</p>

<p>Al:  Why bother?  I don’t want to spend the time or the energy.  </p>

<p>Keiko:  Let me show you my page.  Check out this background.  Don’t you think it’s great?</p>

<p>Al:  Yeah, it’s great.  Can I get back to my book now?  </p>

<p>Keiko:  You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at this.  You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to list information about yourself:  your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, your mood, everything!  You can link to or upload photos and videos, too.  I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text across the top</p>

<p>Al:  Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.</p>

<p>Keiko:  You haven’t even seen my animated gifs.  This funny baby will dance across the page, look!  </p>

<p>Al:  Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick to a simple, uncluttered page. How long did it take you to do all of that?</p>

<p>Keiko:  How long?  Maybe a few hours.</p>

<p>Al:  I’d rather spend a few hours reading a good book.</p>

<p>Keiko:  Suit yourself.  Maybe that’s why you have 22 “friends” and I have 200.  </p>

<p>Al:  Clearly your time has been better spent.  </p>

<p>Gia:  Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long?  I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.  </p>

<p>Logan:  The other side is holding out for more concessions.  I don’t know what they’re thinking.  They made some pretty big demands at the start and I think we’ve given in to most of them.  Now they’re countering with even more demands.</p>

<p>Gia:  They probably know that they have us over a barrel.  After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we don’t want to walk away.</p>

<p>Logan:  That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard.  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave on those additional concessions. </p>

<p>Gia:  So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?</p>

<p>Logan:  That’s how I would characterize it.  If I were you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.</p>

<p>Gia:  Duly noted.  I won’t run out and buy that new house and those three new cars.</p>

<p>Terrell:  She still hasn’t been able to zero in on the cause of your pain and make a diagnosis?  </p>

<p>Sally:  No, she hasn’t.  Part of the problem is that my symptoms are intermittent, and they seem to flare up only when I’m not under observation.  The symptoms themselves are ambiguous, so finding the root cause hasn’t been easy.</p>

<p>Terrell:  I can see how that would be mystifying and frustrating.  Are you still in a lot of pain?</p>

<p>Sally:  The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, but the severe pain in my back is occasional.</p>

<p>Terrell:  I guess you’re not up for going out tonight.</p>

      <title>628 - Introducing a New Product</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9436109</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you hear about the latest, greatest products being developed by America’s most famous companies?  Neither did we, but find out how to describe new products in this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:07
<br />Explanations: 2:48
<br />Fast dialogue: 16:13</p>

<p>Augie:  Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  Our company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.</p>

<p>Lillian:  I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so special about the new products?</p>

<p>Augie:  This line of phones has state-of-the-art technology and never-before-seen features.  It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.  </p>

<p>Lillian:  I thought information was leaked weeks ago.</p>

<p>Augie:  Those were just rumors, and the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Lillian:  Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?  </p>

<p>Augie:  That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.</p>

<p>Lillian:  And steal their thunder.</p>

<p>Augie:  Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scramble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.  They’re really going to make a splash.</p>

<p>Lillian:  I hope so.  I hope all of this hype has been justified.</p>

<p>Augie:  Oh, it will be.  I’ll know soon enough.</p>

<p>Lillian:  How?</p>

<p>Augie:  You’ll be begging me to get you one.</p>

<p>Mariela:  Wow, it looks like you’re working on a big project.  What are all these pages and pages of notes for?</p>

<p>Will:  I’m preparing for my date with Christine.  I want everything to be well-planned and to go without a hitch.</p>

<p>Mariela:  Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re making such detailed plans.</p>

<p>Will:  I want to be ready for every contingency.  For instance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden Cafe instead.</p>

<p>Mariela:  Don’t you think you’re taking the spontaneity out of your date?  Why don’t you play it by ear?  I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pants, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.</p>

<p>Will:  Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into account.  If she wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.  If she prefers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.  </p>

<p>Mariela:  Well, it sounds like you’ve mapped out every possible alternative.  Hey, what’s this?</p>

<p>Will:  Give me that!</p>

<p>Mariela:  I see you’ve mapped out more than just your date.  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your life together: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that...</p>

<p>Will:  That is not meant for you.  And plus, it’s just a tentative plan...</p>

<p>Mariela:  You mean Christine will have some say in it?  </p>

<p>Will:  I may let her pick our children’s names.  Now, get out of here, will ya?!</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:19
<br />Explanations: 4:16
<br />Fast dialogue: 21:30</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  My brother emailed about an emergency situation.  He needs $300 by tomorrow, but how can I get cash to him within 24 hours if I’m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?</p>

<p>Sharon:  That’s easy.  You can wire him the money from here and he can pick it up immediately there.</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  You mean wire him money through the bank?  I already checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to process the wire.  </p>

<p>Sharon:  You can just use a private wire service like Western Union and the money will be available to him immediately.  I wire money all the time using Western Union.  Here is blank form.  I can help you fill it out if you want me to.</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  That would be great.  Hey, this form is for a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire?</p>

<p>Sharon:  Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the receiver or recipient information here and the sender information there.</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  Can I pay in local currency?  I don’t have that much cash in U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>Sharon:  Sure.  When you go to the Western Union office, they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  Is there a fee?</p>

<p>Sharon:  Yeah, there is, and it’s a little higher if you want the money to be available immediately.  If you had more time, you could save a little by using the slower service that makes the money available in three business days.  All done?</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  Yeah, I think so.  Now what?</p>

<p>Sharon:  Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office.  They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number.  Your brother can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office in New York. </p>

<p>Mahmoud:  Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.  </p>

<p>Sharon:  So, what’s the emergency?</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  Tickets go on sale tomorrow for my favorite baseball team.  My brother and I have to get tickets.</p>

<p>Sharon:  That’s the emergency?!</p>

<p>Mahmoud:  For us, it’s a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>Andy:  Doesn’t it make you sick?  We bust our butts around here and the boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.</p>

<p>Nia:  You never know.  He may be a good boss.</p>

<p>Andy:  I doubt it.  He’s getting this opportunity just because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  He didn’t have to pull himself up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.</p>

<p>Nia:  I’m going to wait and see how he is as a manager.  I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.  </p>

<p>Andy:  If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into privilege and old money, you can do no wrong.</p>

<p>Nia:  That’s not true.  He’ll be held accountable for how this department performs.  </p>

<p>Andy:  But when does somebody like me get a break?  Okay, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.  I grew up in a white trash neighborhood.  So what?  I’ve worked hard to get where I am now.  That guy hasn’t paid his dues like I have.</p>

<p>Nia:  You can complain all you want, but it doesn’t change the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.</p>

<p>Andy:  Get used to it?!  Not on your life!</p>

Andy:  But when does somebody like me get a break?  Okay, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.  I grew up in a white trash neighborhood.  So what?  I’ve worked hard to get where I am now.  That guy hasn’t paid his dues like I have.

Nia:  You can complain all you want, but it doesn’t change the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.

Andy:  Get used to it?!  Not on your life!

<p>Flora:  What happened to my car?!</p>

<p>Saul:  I saw it happen.  A car came around the corner and hit the back of your car.  </p>

<p>Flora:  Didn’t the driver stop?</p>

<p>Saul:  No, it was hit-and-run.  The driver just took off.  He was driving like a bat out of hell.  It looks like he caused some damage.    </p>

<p>Flora:  Some damage?!  My car is totaled.  I hope whoever it was gets his license revoked.  Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book at him and he does jail time. But how are the police going to catch someone who leaves the scene of the crime like this?  That guy must be a real jerk!</p>

<p>Saul:  Take it easy.  Maybe he just panicked.  It’s probably his first offense.  Maybe he’s young and just learning how to drive.  </p>

<p>Flora:  Maybe...Hey, why are you defending the driver?</p>

<p>Saul:  Well...</p>

<p>Flora:  You know the person driving the car, don’t you?  You’re not an innocent bystander.  You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!</p>

<p>Saul:  Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, and he drives too fast.  He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender bender.  </p>

<p>Flora:  Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.</p>

<p>Saul:  I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks.  If you don’t call the police, I’ll make sure it’s repaired.  It’ll be as good as new.  </p>

<p>Flora:  Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?</p>

<p>Saul:  No, not at all.  I’ll get your car fixed, right after I wring my nephew’s neck!</p>

<p>Josephine:  Hello.</p>

<p>Ray:  Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray.  We have a meeting today at 10 a.m. and I was wondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.</p>

<p>Josephine:  Oh, sure.  That’s no problem.  Your children are so well-behaved.  Even at their age, they have impeccable manners.</p>

<p>Ray:  Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’re not too much of a handful, thank goodness.</p>

<p>Josephine:  You know what they say: Girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice...</p>

<p>Ray:  It is probably a little easier with two girls.  I feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.  </p>

<p>Josephine:  Six boys!  </p>

<p>Ray:  Yeah, and before we were born, my father thought that children should be seen but not heard.  Was he in for a rude awakening!  We were all very unruly.  Imagine six boys only one year apart.  We got yelled at a lot for being naughty.</p>

<p>Josephine:  But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Girls are different.  They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.  What’s that noise?</p>

<p>Ray:  That noise is my daughters creating a ruckus fighting tooth and nail over a toy.  So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempered!</p>

      <title>621 - Picking a Fight</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking to fight, you’ve come to the right episode.  Learn how to get yourself involved in physical violence – in English!</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:08

<p>I was sitting at my local bar waiting for my friends to arrive to watch the game.  Two guys sitting a few seats away kept giving me strange looks, and one of them said, “What are you looking at?”  I looked around to make sure that he was speaking to me, and before I could respond he said, “You want a piece of me?  You and what army?  Let’s take it outside.” </p>

<p>By this time, I realized that this guy was trying to pick a fight with me and I wasn’t sure what to do.  I was hoping that I could make peace with him or at least hold him off until my friends got there.</p>

<p>I said to him, “I’m just sitting over here minding my own business.  I’m not trying to get in your face.  I don’t have a problem with you.  Let’s just chill out and I’ll buy you and your friend a drink.”  He didn’t seem to like what I’d said.  </p>

<p>“Chill out?” he said.  “I don’t need to chill out.  Those are fighting words.  Let’s take this outside.  I want to see you running with your tail between your legs.”  He got up and started to walk toward me.</p>

<p>Just then, my friends arrived.  When the man saw my six friends walking toward me, he stopped in his tracks.  I think he was weighing his odds and doubting his own chances.  He turned around and said something to his friend, and then they both got up and walked out the door.  </p>

<p>That was a narrow escape.  I had never been so happy to see my friends as I was at that moment.  Needless to say, the first round was on me.</p>

<p>Courteney:  Which of these vendors do you think we should go with?</p>

<p>Dante:  I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondered the options a little longer.  We don’t want to make any rash decisions.</p>

<p>Courteney:  We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you think?  I know you’re of two minds about whether we should be switching vendors in the middle of the year, but I think it’s the right move.  We had sound reasons for doing this, remember?</p>

<p>Dante:  Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second decision, but whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.  </p>

<p>Courteney:  I have to disagree with you there.  We’ve both seen the reports and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it.  We’re going to save money.</p>

<p>Dante:  Okay, I’m willing to make a tentative decision to go with GreatDeal Corp. as our new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in stone.  We’ll revisit this decision in six months to see if they’re working out.</p>

<p>Courteney:  I can live with that.  Now, can we discuss my raise?</p>

<p>Dante:  Raise?  That’s definitely something I’ll need to ponder a lot more.</p>

<p>Nick:  You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for?</p>

<p>Mariah:  For my dresses, of course. I don’t want them to get wrinkles in them.  I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessories; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for my makeup and toiletries.  </p>

<p>Nick:  What do you need all that for?!</p>

<p>Mariah:  I’m preparing for all contingencies.  You never know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped with anything I’ll need.  </p>

<p>Nick:  I should have expected this when I married a clothes horse.  I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe.</p>

<p>Mariah:  I was thinking about it.  I’m sure I can make room.  All of my bags are expandable.</p>

<p>Russell:  Why aren’t you eating?  Is there something the matter with your food?</p>

<p>Nadia:  No, the food is fine.  </p>

<p>Russell:  What’s wrong?  </p>

<p>Nadia:  I’m not sure how to put this.  I really like going to diners and hole in the walls with you, and I love mom and pop restaurants as much as you do.  For me, it’s the food that counts, not the ambiance, but...</p>

<p>Russell:  I thought you’d love this place.  It’s my favorite greasy spoon.  </p>

<p>Nadia:  I do like it.  It’s just that when you invited me out for my birthday and said that it would be something really special, I thought you might take me somewhere else.</p>

<p>Russell:  Is that why you wore that nice new dress?  You thought I was taking you to a fancy restaurant, with tablecloths, mood lighting, and snooty waiters.</p>

<p>Nadia:  Well...</p>

<p>Russell:  This is much better, don’t you think?  We get to sit in this comfortable booth, listen to the jukebox, and watch our food being cooked behind the counter.  I can’t think of a better dining experience.  Don’t you agree?</p>

<p>Nadia:  Uh, sure.</p>

<p>Russell:  And don’t think you’re not getting something special for your birthday.  I planned it all ahead of time.</p>

<p>Nadia:  You did?  Really?  What is it?</p>

<p>Russell:  I ordered you a whole pie!</p>

<p>Jan:  We’re almost done.  We just need to get some bathroom supplies for Kimberly.</p>

<p>Tim:  Okay, here are some towels, a bathmat and a bathroom scale.  Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.  She’ll need some rubber gloves, disinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.</p>

<p>Jan:  All right.  We have all that.  Where are you going?</p>

<p>Tim:  She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder.  She’ll need a trashcan, too.</p>

<p>Jan:  Okay, I think we’re all done. Kimberly is moving into an apartment with college roommates, not starting her own bathroom supply store.  Let’s not go overboard.</p>

<p>Tim:  I just need to get a couple more things.</p>

<p>Jan:  What?</p>

<p>Tim:  I’m buying her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex.  She’ll be living on her own for the first time and she’ll need all that.</p>

<p>Jan:  Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex?!  She can shop for herself, you know.  You don’t need to buy her a six-month supply.</p>

<p>Tim:  Clearly you don’t know college students.  They’ll go through that in a week!</p>

<p>Alex:  Where are you going?</p>

<p>Kenya:  I’m going to meet my business mentor.  </p>

<p>Alex:  Your business mentor?  What do you do with a business mentor?</p>

<p>Kenya:  Well, my mentor is like an advisor.  We meet regularly and I get her feedback and guidance with my ideas on starting a business.</p>

<p>Alex:  Oh, so you’re her protégé?</p>

<p>Kenya:  No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with my ideas and she helps me hash them out.  She’s a successful entrepreneur and I’m there to learn from her experience.  </p>

<p>Alex:  How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were you already friends?</p>

<p>Kenya:  No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually.  I’ve read about her company and her many successes, and I wrote her a letter telling her about me and what I hope to accomplish.  She agreed to meet with me, and at that first meeting, we really clicked and now we meet once a month.</p>

<p>Alex:  That’s very generous of her.  What does she get out of it?</p>

<p>Kenya:  I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me pointers and sharing her expertise.  I’m very appreciative and she says I remind her a lot of herself when she was my age.  I take that as a huge compliment.</p>

<p>Alex:  You should.  If you’re like her, you’ll be a multi-millionaire in no time flat.</p>

<p>Sally:  Why are wasting your time on your day off watching these daytime talk shows?</p>

<p>Jerry:  I think they’re entertaining.</p>

<p>Sally:  You’ve got to be kidding.  The only people who are booked as guests on those shows are losers or exhibitionists who want attention.  </p>

<p>Jerry:  No, they’re not.  These shows are all about human drama and tragedy, something we can all relate to.  </p>

<p>Sally:  Give me a break!  The people who appear on these shows want fame at any cost and the producers of the shows exploit them for ratings.  They’re full of salacious details that nobody should talk about in public, and that I certainly don’t want to hear.</p>

<p>Jerry:  I completely disagree.  If you get off your high horse for a minute, you may learn something. </p>

<p>Sally:  Like what?</p>

<p>Jerry:  Like how to get rid of an annoying wife and get away with it!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you feel the earth move under your feet? You may be experiencing an earthquake.  Learn how to talk about it in English before it’s too late.</p>

<p>Jamal:  Did you feel that?  </p>

<p>Keisha:  Was that an earthquake?  </p>

<p>Jamal:  Yes, I think so.  Turn on the news.  </p>

<p>Newscaster:  “Reports are coming in about an earthquake that occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.  We spoke with a seismologist at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.  The epicenter was near downtown, along one of the major faults, and the seismologist warns that there will be some aftershocks.”</p>

<p>Keisha:  Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high-intensity one.  I wish they could predict more accurately when those earthquakes are going to happen.  </p>

<p>Jamal:  Yeah, me, too.  I’ve looked around the house and don’t see any damage, though.  I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster area.</p>

<p>Keisha:  Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve made in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.  </p>

<p>Jamal:  In that case, will you be sending aid?  I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.</p>

<p>Keisha:  You won’t be getting any aid from me.  If you’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.</p>

Keisha:  You won’t be getting any aid from me.  If you’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.

<p>Zuly:  Hello.</p>

<p>Ricardo:  Hi, Zuly.  How are you?</p>

<p>Zuly:  Oh, Ricardo, it’s you.  I’m doing okay.  How are you?</p>

<p>Ricardo:  I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.</p>

<p>Zuly:  Thanks a lot.  Carla was born three weeks ago, and she was 8 pounds, 3 ounces.  </p>

<p>Ricardo:  That’s great!  How does it feel to be a first-time parent?</p>

<p>Zuly:  It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newborn.  I’m learning everything from scratch, everything from how to breastfeed and bottle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car seat and a stroller.  </p>

<p>Ricardo:  You sound overwhelmed. I remember when Adam, our first child, was born.
<br />There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all of those diapers!</p>

<p>Zuly:  Exactly.  I’m exhausted all the time.  In fact, I find myself dozing off at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>Ricardo:  I really sympathize with you, but these days will pass quickly, and then you’ll have such great memories.  Have you had much sleep?</p>

<p>Zuly:  Zzzzzzzz!</p>

<p>Ricardo:  Zuly?  Zuly?</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?  </p>

<p>It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker today.  Our speaker is actually a person who needs no introduction, since she is well known in our field as one of its great innovators.  Edwina Litton has been called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field.  That’s because she has strived to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so important.  </p>

<p>Dr. Litton holds four advanced degrees and has an honorary doctorate from Harward University.  In her much-anticipated speech today, she will address what she sees as the future of our field.  </p>

<p>Without further ado, please join me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton.</p>

<p>Dad:  Out where?</p>

<p>Eva:  Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman.  You don’t need be so overbearing.  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.  </p>

<p>Dad:  As long as you live under my roof, you’ll live by my rules.  Now, where are you going?</p>

<p>Eva:  I’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.  I’ll be home before curfew.</p>

<p>Dad:  I don’t like that guy, Damien.  He’s not good enough for you.  He’s a troublemaker.  Mark my words:  That kid is going nowhere fast.  Is this a date?</p>

<p>Eva:  No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.  </p>

<p>Dad:  Alone?  With no supervision?  What is this world coming to?</p>

<p>Eva:  Dad, we’re not kids anymore.  We’re both 17.  </p>

<p>Dad:  That’s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.  </p>

<p>Eva:  What are you doing?</p>

<p>Dad:  I’m putting on my coat.</p>

<p>Eva:  Why?</p>

<p>Dad:  You and Damien need a chaperon.</p>

<p>Eva:  No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s with you tagging along as our chaperon.  That would be humiliating.</p>

<p>Dad:  Good, then you’ll stay home.  So, what movie should we watch tonight?</p>

<p>Eva:  Huh!</p>

<p>Shannon:  It looks like you’re ready for your trip.  You must be psyched.</p>

<p>Ignacio:  Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready.  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.</p>

<p>Shannon:  I could pick up your mail for you.</p>

<p>Ignacio:  Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also called the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.  Tomorrow I’ll arrange for my bank to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my utilities cut off or accrue any late fees.  </p>

<p>Shannon:  I could pay your bills for you.  I don’t mind.</p>

<p>Ignacio:  It’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it covered.  This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house.  He agreed to water them for me while I’m gone.</p>

<p>Shannon:  I could have come over and watered your plants.  That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.</p>

<p>Ignacio:  Thanks for being willing to do that.  As always, you’re so helpful. </p>

<p>Shannon:  Oh, I try my best...</p>

<p>Ignacio:  I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you.</p>

<p>Shannon:  Of course you can.  Just name it!  </p>

<p>Ignacio:  You know my dog, Rex... </p>

<p>Shannon:  Oh, no...</p>

<p>Ignacio:  I could board him at a kennel, but he’s had bad luck at kennels.  Could you look after him while I’m gone?</p>

<p>Shannon:  No way!</p>

<p>Ignacio:  Why?</p>

<p>Shannon:  Why don’t you ask the people who worked at those kennels where Rex has been?  I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker!</p>

<p>Mary:  I want to buy a new car, but I’m not sure what I want.</p>

<p>Robert:  Well, you’ve come to the right place.  We have a very large selection of cars and trucks – just about any type of vehicle you can think of.  Why don’t I show you around?</p>

<p>Mary:  Okay, that would be great.</p>

<p>Robert:  Over here, we have some nice compacts and mid-size cars.  We have 2-door or 4-door sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks.  We even have this beautiful convertible sports car.  What do you think?</p>

<p>Mary:  It’s very nice, but I want something a little bigger for my family.</p>

<p>Robert:  Okay, no sweat.  Walk this way and you’ll see our station wagons, mini-vans, and SUVs.  These seat anywhere from six to 10 people.  We even have pickups.</p>

<p>Mary:  I’m not sure if any of these will fit my family?</p>

<p>Robert:  How many children do you have?</p>

<p>Mary:  Eleven.</p>

<p>Robert:  Eleven?  In that case, you might want to buy two!</p>

<p>Chad:  Okay, this report is finally finished.</p>

<p>Pamela:  Oh, not quite.  I’m still working on the formatting. </p>

<p>Chad:  We used the standard formatting for this type of report.  I don’t think we should play around with the text.  </p>

<p>Pamela:  Standard is boring.  I want our report to be special.  I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shading, and centering some of the text.</p>

<p>Chad:  No, I really think that’s a bad idea.  All of the text should be flush left, and nobody else puts shading in their reports.  It cuts down on readability.</p>

<p>Pamela:  Readability is secondary to presentation.  Look, I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bullets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.  This will all make each page look more professional. </p>

<p>Chad:  I don’t think it’s going to have your intended effect.  </p>

<p>Pamela:  Really?</p>

<p>Chad:  Yes, instead of thinking we’re being professional, they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.</p>

<p>Pamela:  Don’t be so stodgy.  Hey, I think adding some clip art would really jazz things up, don’t you?</p>

<p>Chad:  Oh, God!</p>

<p>Gisele:  Our phone has been ringing off the hook all weekend.  What’s the deal?</p>

<p>Nobu:  I think it’s Jeanine.  </p>

<p>Gisele:  Jeanine…Jeanine…Is that the woman you’ve been going out with?</p>

<p>Nobu:  Yeah, it’s her.  I tried to let her down easy, but she’s not taking the hint.  </p>

<p>Gisele:  I see.  That’s why you’ve been screening calls.  Why don’t you just talk to her and tell her that you don’t think you’re right for each other, take the direct approach?</p>

<p>Nobu:  I figure if I don’t take her calls for a few more days, she’ll get the message.</p>

<p>Gisele:  Are you sure?  There are 14 new voicemail messages.  How many of those do you think are from Jeanine?</p>

<p>Nobu:  All of them.  I let calls go to voicemail if I see her phone number on caller ID.  I guess I should listen to those messages – sooner or later.</p>

<p>Gisele:  Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.</p>

<p>Nobu:  I was thinking of taking the phone off the hook for the rest of day.  What do you think?</p>

<p>Gisele:  You do that and she’ll be on your doorstep to make sure nothing bad has happened to you.  Listen, you don’t want to be honest with her, but you want her to stop pestering you, right?  In that case, you only have one option.</p>

<p>Nobu:  What?</p>

<p>Gisele:  Tell her you’re moving to Timbuktu!</p>

      <title>606 - Reading a Bus Schedule</title>
      <link>http://www.eslpod.com/website/show_podcast.php?issue_id=9098047</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to read a bus schedule in English on this episode.</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:18
<br />Explanations: 3:59
<br />Fast dialogue: 18:56</p>

<p>This was my first visit to McQuillanville.  I wanted to avoid driving, so I decided to take the bus around the city.  However, I was having some trouble figuring out the bus schedule.</p>

<p>Louisa:  Excuse me, could you help me read this bus schedule?</p>

<p>Curt:  I can try.  Where do you want to go?</p>

<p>Louisa:  I want to go downtown, but I’m not sure which bus to take.</p>

<p>Curt:  Let me see that bus schedule.  Here’s a listing of the route numbers on the back of this schedule.  Look for a bus that goes downtown.</p>

<p>Louisa:  Oh, I see.  That’s great.  Tomorrow, I want to arrive at the Podcast Museum at 10 a.m. when it opens.  Which bus will I have to take?</p>

<p>Curt:  Let me look at this bus schedule.  That’s simple.  All you have to do is find the stop closest to the museum, then look down the column to find the arrival time of 10 a.m. or before, and work backwards to see what time that bus passes the stop at your starting point.  Got it?</p>

<p>Louisa:  I think so, but I don’t think there’s a bus that goes directly from here to downtown.  </p>

<p>Curt:  In that case, it says on the schedule that you’ll need to get a transfer from the driver of the first bus so you can ride for free on the second bus.  Just take the additional time into account.  Mornings are peak times, and according to this schedule, the buses run more frequently to accommodate commuters, so it shouldn’t take you a lot longer.  It also says here that you’ll need to have a bus pass or exact change for the fare when you board.</p>

<p>Louisa:  Thanks a lot for all the help.  Do you know how much the fare is?</p>

<p>Curt:  I have no idea. I’ve never ridden the bus before in McQuillanville.</p>

<p>Louisa:  Then how do you know so much about riding the bus?</p>

<p>Curt:  I can read.</p>

<p>Dad:  What are you working on, honey?</p>

<p>Mariko:  It’s a project for school about the Earth and its place in the universe.  I have to write a report and build a model of what scientists can see with a telescope in space.</p>

<p>Dad:  I can help you with that.  I was always good in science, especially astronomy.</p>

<p>Mariko:  Okay, Dad.  If I need help, I’ll ask you.</p>

<p>Dad:  Is that the report you’re writing right now?</p>

<p>Mariko:  Yes.</p>

<p>Dad:  Make sure you include all of the planets in the solar system.</p>

<p>Mariko:  I plan to, Dad.</p>

<p>Dad:  Don’t forget to talk about the Big Bang.  Oh yeah, and talk about traveling through space and how many light years it would take.  Are you going to include stars, asteroids, and other galaxies in your model?</p>

<p>Mariko:  No, the teacher didn’t say we had to.</p>

<p>Dad:  Yes, but including some of those would set your project apart from the others, don’t you think?  </p>

<p>Mariko:  Sure, Dad.  </p>

<p>Dad:  It would be out of this world!</p>

<p>Slow dialogue: 1:23

<br />Fast dialogue: 14:57</p>

<p>Alex:  Good morning.  What’s with the gloom and doom?</p>

<p>Paige:  Have you seen this morning’s newspaper?</p>

<p>Alex:  No, I haven’t.  </p>

<p>Paige:  You’d better read this.  It’s an article about our company.</p>

<p>Alex:  Let me see that.  This is outrageous!  How can anybody print such lies?  We’re not on the verge of going under.  How did they get a hold of so much misleading and outright wrong information?</p>

<p>Paige:  What I’m irate about is what it says about you, as the owner.  The article is full of innuendos about your background.  It’s nothing short of character assassination.  We’ll sue the paper for defamation of character.</p>

<p>Alex:  I’m not worried about my personal reputation.  I’m more concerned about the company’s image.  I’m going down to that paper and making them print a retraction.</p>

<p>Paige:  How’re you going to do that?</p>

<p>Alex:  After I call the reporter a no-good mudslinger, I’ll give him the facts, the ones he neglected to include in this story.</p>

<p>Paige:  Be careful what you say to him, especially in front of his coworkers.  You don’t want him suing you for slander!</p>

Alex:  Good morning.  What’s with the gloom and doom?

Paige:  Have you seen this morning’s newspaper?

Alex:  No, I haven’t.

Paige:  You’d better read this.  It’s an article about our company.

Alex:  Let me see that.  This is outrageous!  How can anybody print such lies?  We’re not on the verge of going under.  How did they get a hold of so much misleading and outright wrong information?

Paige:  What I’m irate about is what it says about you, as the owner.  The article is full of innuendos about your background.  It’s nothing short of character assassination.  We’ll sue the paper for defamation of character.

Alex:  I’m not worried about my personal reputation.  I’m more concerned about the company’s image.  I’m going down to that paper and making them print a retraction.

Paige:  How’re you going to do that?

Alex:  After I call the reporter a no-good mudslinger, I’ll give him the facts, the ones he neglected to include in this story.

Paige:  Be careful what you say to him, especially in front of his coworkers.  You don’t want him suing you for slander!

<p>Claudia:  Oh, that was so good.  I’ve never seen anything better.  Bravo!  Bravo!</p>

<p>Javier:  There’s no need for a standing ovation and stop gushing.  The performers did a passable job.  It was nothing to write home about.</p>

<p>Claudia:  You are so jaded.  That performance was genius.  It took my breath away.</p>

<p>Javier:  I thought the first number was okay, and none of the dancers embarrassed themselves, but that’s all I can say about it.  </p>

<p>Claudia:  I’m sure they’d thank you for that faint praise.  Me?  I’ve never seen anything better.</p>

<p>Javier:  Now how can you say that?  That’s just over the top.  </p>

<p>Claudia:  If I can’t be effusive, who can?  How many times will we see our granddaughter in a school play?</p>

<p>Javier:  She’s seven years old and she played a tomato!</p>

<p>Claudia:  Yes, but don’t forget: she played the lead tomato!</p>

<p>Brad:  Are you all right?</p>

<p>Lydia:  What...what happened?</p>

<p>Brad:  You lost consciousness and someone called 911.  My name is Brad and I’m a paramedic.  Can you answer a few questions for me?</p>

<p>Lydia:  I’ll try.  </p>

<p>Brad:  Have you ever blacked out before?</p>

<p>Lydia:  No, I don’t think so.  </p>

<p>Brad:  Do you have a history of medical problems?  Do you have any allergies to medication?</p>

<p>Lydia:  Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Brad:  Okay.  Where are you hurt?  Are you in any pain?</p>

<p>Lydia:  I think I hit my head when I fell down.  Oh, it’s bleeding.  Oh my God, I’m bleeding!</p>

<p>Brad:  Stay calm and let me examine the wound.  </p>

<p>Lydia:  Oh my God, I’m going to bleed to death!  </p>

<p>Brad:  Try to stay still.  The wound doesn’t look too serious, but we’ll get you to the hospital to get checked out.  We’ll get a stretcher so we can get you into the ambulance and take you to the emergency room.  Try to stay clam.</p>

<p>Lydia:  Calm?  How can I stay calm when I’m bleeding to death?  I need a helicopter to take me to the hospital right away.  Call medivac!</p>

<p>Brad:  Ma’am, you don’t need a helicopter.  I’m just going to give you a little injection to help you with the pain and to help you relax.</p>

<p>Lydia:  I’m going to die...I’m going to...</p>

<p>Brad:  Phew!</p>

<p>Lorraine:  Hi, this is a surprise.  To what do I owe this pleasure?</p>

<p>Terrance:  Can’t I just drop in on my little sister unannounced to see how she is?  I was just in this neck of the woods and thought I would pay you a visit.</p>

<p>Lorraine:  Sure you were.  Of course, I’m glad to see you, but this is just a little out of the blue.</p>

<p>Terrance:  What do you mean?</p>

<p>Lorraine:  I haven’t seen you in over five months, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Terrance:  Well, I wasn’t exactly in the neighborhood, but I wanted to see my favorite sister.</p>

<p>Lorraine:  Your only sister.  Okay, out with it.  What are you doing here?</p>

<p>Terrance:  Uh, well, I was thinking of taking a year off from school to pursue my art.  I really feel I need to devote some time to my painting to see if I can make it as an artist.  </p>

<p>Lorraine:  Mom and Dad are not going to like that.</p>

<p>Terrance:  I know and that’s where you come in.</p>

<p>Lorraine:  You want me to run interference for you with Mom and Dad.</p>

<p>Terrance:  Yeah, they would take it a lot better coming from you, don’t you think?</p>

<p>Lorraine:  No, I don’t.  </p>

<p>Terrance:  You’ve always been the responsible one...I’m just saying...</p>

<p>Lorraine:  And I’m just saying that I’m not going to do your dirty work for you!</p>
